# Shuttler

This repository contains the code for Shuttler Android, a mobile app that allows students at SUNY Plattsburgh to track the college shuttle position in real-time and get updates on its status. This app was developed by [Coding Hub](https://coding-hub.com), a club at SUNY Plattsburgh dedicated to develop software solutions, web and mobile applications, to improve the services on Campus. We also offer build portfolio websites for students and provide resources for anyone who is interested in learning how to code. If you are a student at SUNY Plattsburgh and would like to join us, our meeting dates will be posted soon. So keep yourselves updated here or the website.

## Overview

### Why Shuttler?
Since SUNY Plattsburgh campus is far from places like Walmart, Target, the mall, etc, we have a shuttle that runs every 30 minutes and takes the students to these places. However, sometimes the driver doesn't show up, the shuttle doesn't run or it is late and there is not way for students to know that. Shuttler attempts to solve this problem by allowing students to see the current position of the shuttle on a map as well as get real-time notifications such us when the shuttle is not running, is late, etc.
